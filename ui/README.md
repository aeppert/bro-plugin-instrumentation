## Notes

This is a basic user interface designed to interpret and display data generated by the instrumentation plugin.

There are a few manual steps to launch this:

* Copy function profiling output (as JSON: will be called 'bro-profile-function' if using the default 'instrument.bro' script) named 'profile.json' in the 'bin' directory.
* Copy runtime profiling output (as JSON: will be called 'bro-profile-collection' if using the default 'instrument.bro' script) named 'collection.json' in the 'bin' directory.
* Create a symlink named 'bro' in the 'bin' directory which points to the share/bro directory containing bro scripts.
* Change the working directory to the 'bin' directory and execute 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer'
* Direct the browser to localhost:8000
* Enjoy

This project includes a number of files that would not really be necessary in the presence of e.g. grunt and bower.  These are intended to be a convenience for folks who would like to use the user interface without having to actually build anything.
