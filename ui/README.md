## Notes

This is a basic user interface designed to interpret and display data generated by the instrumentation plugin.  Run 'server.sh' to get started.

This project includes a number of files that would not really be necessary in the presence of e.g. grunt and bower.  These are intended to be a convenience for folks who would like to use the user interface without having to actually build anything.
